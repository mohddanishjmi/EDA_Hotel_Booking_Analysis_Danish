Before visualize any data from data set we have to data wrangling For that, we are checked the null value of all the columns. After checking, when we are getting a column which has more number of null values, dropped that column by using the 'drop'method. in this way, we are dropped the 'company'column. When we are find minimal number of null values, filling these null values with neccessary values as per requirements by using.fillna() Different charts are used for data visualization so that better insights and Business objectives is attained.
